Work in Progress

The overall solution objective is improved health and wellness through controlled diet and exercise activities, paving way for reduced costs of diagnosing and treating chronic diseases. Healthy Living Partner(HLP) offers this solution with its core features namely,Health Status Check, Glucose Monitor, Diet Assistant, Exercise Activity Unit, Performance Monitor and API.

Machine Learning algorithm is the main driver behind  decisions made in terms of what actions to take, as well as, recommend to the user. It collects and analyzes data generated by the user for guidance on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. For these reasons it is absolutely necessary for the Machine learning algorithm to continue to perfect itself in learning, training and making predictions in  support of decisions.

As articulated and demonstrated in this proposal, Logistic Regression and Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras) algorithms were used to demonstrate the capabilities of the application of machine learning in this solution to determine who’s healthy and who’s not healthy. Furthermore, output trends indicate improving or deteriorating health conditions.
Improvement
Expanding the API coverage
There are other health related devices that monitor other conditions in humans, especially those with pre-existing conditions. Expanding the API coverage to other test, reporting and monitoring devices for critical data collection and analysis to support decisions.
Biases in the data
It is highly recommended to make provision that will address any anticipated and occuring biases in the dataset. 

Multiple decision criteria
Investigate the use of algorithms that utilize multiple decision criterias for improved accuracy.

Automation of the process
Since the application will constantly collect data, the Machine Learning process needs to be automated and periodically updated for performance and accuracy.
