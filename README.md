This project is focused on demonstrating and articulating how Machine Learning applications can be applied to the Healthy Living Partner mobile app, which is a product solution for achieving a healthy lifestyle through controlled and monitored habits.

As a component within a larger solution, the machine learning aspect of the product is the core decision support unit. It takes in user data, analyze, train, test using classification model in supervised learning.

Machine Learning algorithm is the main driver behind  decisions made in terms of what actions to take, as well as, recommend to the user. It collects and analyzes data generated by the user for guidance on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. For these reasons it is absolutely necessary for the Machine learning algorithm to continue to perfect itself in learning, training and making predictions in  support of decisions.
